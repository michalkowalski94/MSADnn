# MSADnn
Mammography Screening Abnormality Detection with neural networks 
All of models were trained on DDSM dataset, prepared with [ddsm_tools](https://github.com/fjeg/ddsm_tools) mentioned in [CBIS-DDSM publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017177) and own code posted as [dataset_utils]().
